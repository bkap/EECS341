This is a project for EECS 341 (databases) at CWRU. It's a course scheduling
system.

Setting up the project:
You need Python 2.6 or 2.7 and a database backend.
It's currently configured to use Postgresql with the psycopg2 connector. I made
a database called eecs341, made a user wih name eecs341 and password eecs341.
If you want to use something else (say, SQLite which is easier to use but only
lets one person connect at a time), change the appropriate values in
settings.py
